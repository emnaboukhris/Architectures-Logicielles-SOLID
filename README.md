# SOLID
The SOLID principles are design principles that are used in Object-Oriented software development in order to encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible applications. In this workshop, we will iterate through each principle where a given problem has already been addressed. We will analyze the existing solution, identify its shortcomings and then suggest a more SOLID design for it.



SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
OCP (Open-Closed Principle)
LSP (Liskov Substituion Principle)
ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
